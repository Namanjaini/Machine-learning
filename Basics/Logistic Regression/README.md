# Logistic Regression
## Implementing Logistic regression and see how it works on data.
I have downloaded Dataset for logistic regression with one variable and Dataset for logistic regression with multiple variable
### 1. Build a logistic regression model to predict whether a student gets admitted into a university.
Suppose that you are the administrator of a university department and you want to determine each applicant’s chance of admission based on their results on two exams. You have data from previous applicants that you can use as a training set for logistic regression. For each training example, you have the applicant’s scores on two exams and the admissions decision. Your task is to build a classiﬁcation model that estimates an applicant’s probability of admission based the scores from those two exams. 
### 2. Regularized logistic regression
Implement regularized logistic regression to predict whether microchips from a fabrication plant passes quality assurance (QA). During QA, each microchip goes through various tests to ensure it is functioning correctly. Suppose you are the product manager of the factory and you have the test results for some microchips on two diﬀerent tests. From these two tests, you would like to determine whether the microchips should be accepted or rejected.
