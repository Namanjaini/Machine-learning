# Linear Regression  
## Implementing linear regression and see how it works on data
I have downloaded Dataset for linear regression with one variable and Dataset for linear regression with multiple variable 
### 1. Implement linear regression with one variable to predict proﬁts for a food truck
Suppose you are the CEO of a restaurant franchise and are considering diﬀerent cities for opening a new outlet. The chain already has trucks in various cities and you have data for proﬁts and populations from the cities. You would like to use this data to help you select which city to expand to next.
### 2. Implement linear regression with multiple variables to predict the prices of houses
Suppose you are selling your house and you want to know what a good market price would be. One way to do this is to ﬁrst collect information on recent houses sold and make a model of housing prices. The ﬁle ex1data2.txt contains a training set of housing prices in Portland, Oregon. The ﬁrst column is the size of the house (in square feet), the second column is the number of bedrooms, and the third column is the price of the house.
