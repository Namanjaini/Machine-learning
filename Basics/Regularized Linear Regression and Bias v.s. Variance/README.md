# Regularized Linear Regression and Bias v.s. Variance
##  you will implement regularized linear regression and use it to study models with diﬀerent bias-variance properties.
I have downloaded Dataset for Neural Networks Learning
### 1. Regularized Linear Regression
Implement regularized linear regression to predict the amount of water ﬂowing out of a dam using the change of water level in a reservoir. 
### 2. Bias vs Variance
Plot training and test errors on a learning curve to diagnose bias-variance problems.
### 3 Polynomial regression
The problem with our linear model was that it was too simple for the data and resulted in underﬁtting (high bias). Address this problem by adding more features.
