# Multi-class Classiﬁcation and Neural Networks
## Implement one-vs-all logistic regression and neural networks to recognize hand-written digits
I have downloaded Dataset for Multi-class Classiﬁcation and Neural Networks
### 1. Multi-class Classiﬁcation
Use logistic regression and neural networks to recognize handwritten digits (from 0 to 9). Automated handwritten digit recognition is widely used today - from recognizing zip codes (postal codes) on mail envelopes to recognizing amounts written on bank checks. 
### 2. Neural Networks
 Implement a neural network to recognize handwritten digits using the same training set as before. The neural network will be able to represent complex models that form non-linear hypotheses. The goal is to implement the feedforward propagation algorithm to use our weights for prediction.
