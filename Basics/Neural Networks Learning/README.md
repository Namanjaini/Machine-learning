#  Neural Networks Learning
## Implement the backpropagation algorithm for neural networks and apply it to the task of hand-written digit recognition. 
I have downloaded Dataset for Neural Networks Learning
### 1. Neural Networks
implement the backpropagation algorithm to learn the parameters for the neural network.
### 2. Backpropagation
implement the backpropagation algorithm to compute the gradient for the neural network cost function. You will need to complete 
the nnCostFunction.mso that it returns an appropriate value for grad. Once you have computed the gradient,you will be able to train the 
neural networkby minimizing the cost function J(Î˜) using an advanced optimizer such as fmincg
