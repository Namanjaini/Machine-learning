# Anomaly Detection and Recommender Systems
## 1. Anomaly detection
I have implemented an anomaly detection algorithm to detect anomalous behavior in server computers. The features measure the throughput (mb/s) and latency (ms) of response of each server. While the servers were operating, I collected 307 examples of how they were behaving, and thus have an unlabeled dataset {x(1),...,x(m)}. I suspect that the vast majority of these examples are “normal” (non-anomalous) examples of the servers operating normally, but there might also be some examples of servers acting anomalously within this dataset
## 2. Recommender Systems
 I have implemented the collaborative ﬁltering learning algorithm and applied it to a dataset of movie ratings. This dataset consists of ratings on a scale of 1 to 5. The dataset has 943 users and 1682 movies.
