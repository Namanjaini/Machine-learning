# Support Vector Machines
## Here I will be using support vector machines (SVMs) to build a spam classiﬁer
I have downloaded Dataset for this.
### 1. Support Vector Machines
I will be using support vector machines (SVMs) with various example 2D datasets. Experimenting with these datasets will help you gain an intuition of how SVMs work and how to use a Gaussian kernel with SVMs.
### 2.Spam Classification
use SVMs to build your own spam ﬁlter.
