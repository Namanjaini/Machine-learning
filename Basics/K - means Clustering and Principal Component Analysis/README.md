# K-means Clustering
## Here I have implemented the K-means algorithm and use it for image compression.
First start on an example 2D dataset that will help gaining an intuition of how the K-means algorithm works. After that,I have use the K-means algorithm for image compression by reducing the number of colors that occur in an image to only those that are most common in that image.I have downloaded Dataset for this.
# Principal Component Analysis
## In this exercise, I have use principal component analysis (PCA) to perform dimensionality reduction.
I have Ô¨Årst experiment with an example 2D dataset to get intuition on how PCA works, and then use it on a bigger dataset of 5000 face image dataset
